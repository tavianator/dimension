This is Dimension, a project to create a GPLed, POV-Ray compatible ray tracer.
It is currently stable but lacking in features, to the point of unusability.
But if you want to try it anyway, see the INSTALL file for how to compile and
run it.  For a quick demo, run ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make check, and
look at tests/dimension/demo.{pov,png}.

Documentation for the `dimension' program will eventually be in the doc/
directory.  (Out of date) API documentation for the ray tracing library
libdimension is also in doc/.
