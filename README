This is Dimension, a project to create a GPLed high quality ray-tracer. It is
currently stable but lacking in features.  But if you want to try it anyway, see
the INSTALL file for how to compile and run it.  For a quick demo, run
  $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make check
and look at tests/dimension/demo.{dmnsn,png}.
